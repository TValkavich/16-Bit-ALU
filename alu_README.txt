CSE 341 Project 2 README

The random numbers generated for the 1000 inputs were created with a python script and only generated numbers between 0 - 9999 with no negatives

For analyizing the zero and temporal delays of the ALU, I was not aware until after I ran my tests that negative inputs needed to be included so I ran
the 2 negative inputs together but seperate from the 5 positive inputs.
